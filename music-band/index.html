      <h2>How they started:</h2>
      <p class="infor">
        Queen are a British rock band formed in London in 1970. ... Before
        forming Queen, May and Taylor had played together in the band Smile.
        Mercury was a fan of Smile and encouraged them to experiment with more
        elaborate stage and recording techniques. He joined in 1970 and
        suggested the name "Queen".

      <h2>Genre:</h2>
      <p class="head2">Rock, Classic Rock,Synth-pop</p>
      <h2>Controversy:</h2>
      <p class="infor">
        Queen may not have been the most squeaky-clean band ever (partially
        thanks to Freddie Mercury's antics) but some fans might not know they
        made a music video so controversial it was banned from MTV.
        Surprisingly, a Queen music video which seemed innocuous in Britain was
        considered obscene in North America.
