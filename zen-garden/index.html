        <h1>The Road to Enlightenment</h1>
        <p>
          Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of
          browser-specific tags, incompatible
          <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>s, broken
          <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> support, and abandoned
          browsers.
        </p>
        <p>
          We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been
          achieved thanks to the tireless efforts of folk like the
          <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>,
          <abbr title="Web Standards Project">WaSP</abbr>, and the major browser
          creators.

          The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important
          lessons of the masters. Begin to see with clarity. Learn to use the
          time-honored techniques in new and invigorating fashion. Become one
          with the web.
        </p>

        <h1>So What is This About?</h1>
        <p>
          There is a continuing need to show the power of
          <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. The Zen Garden aims
          to excite, inspire, and encourage participation. To begin, view some
          of the existing designs in the list. Clicking on any one will load the
          style sheet into this very page. The
          <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> remains the same,
          the only thing that has changed is the external
          <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> file. Yes, really.
        </p>
        <p>
          <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> allows complete and
          total control over the style of a hypertext document. The only way
          this can be illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by
          demonstrating what it can truly be, once the reins are placed in the
          hands of those able to create beauty from structure. Designers and
          coders alike have contributed to the beauty of the web; we can always
          push it further.
        </p>

        <h1>Participation</h1>
        <p>
          Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying this
          page, so strong
          <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> skills are necessary
          too, but the example files are commented well enough that even
          <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> novices can use them
          as starting points. Please see the
          <a
            href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/zengarden/resources/"
            title="A listing of CSS-related resources"
            ><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> Resource Guide</a
          >
          for advanced tutorials and tips on working with
          <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the
          <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>. This may seem
          daunting at first if you&#8217;ve never worked this way before, but
          follow the listed links to learn more, and use the sample files as a
          guide.
